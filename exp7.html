    <p>
      <strong><u>Aim</u></strong
      >: Projectile motion is a path traveled by an object influenced by the initial
      velocity, launch angle, and the acceleration due to gravity. In this
      experiment you will predict the spot a steel ball will land after being
      launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Apparatus</u></strong
      >: Computer
       ,Vernier Projectile Launcher
      ,Vernier lab quest
      ,Small cardboard box
      ,Steel ball
      ,Meter stick
      ,Waxed paper
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Initial Setup</u></strong>:
      
      <ul>
          <li>Position the launcher next to the edge of your table. Eventually you
              will fire a ball horizontally that will travel several meters, so plan for
              this when choosing a location. </li>
          <li>Use the lower knob on the back of the unit to adjust the position of
              the launch chamber until level. Then tighten the knob to maintain this
              position. </li>
          <li> Next, use the upper knob on the back of the launcher to set the scale
              to 0 degrees. Move the scale so the notch of the launcher chamber is
              at 0 degrees. This setting accounts for deviation of the tabletop from
              horizontal. </li>
          <li>Connect the projectile launcher to the labquest. </li>
          <li> Connect the hand pump to the projectile launcher. Set the release
              pressure by adjusting the range knob. Turn the knob clockwise for
              higher pressure and higher launch speed. Turn the knob counterclockwise for lower pressure and lower launch speed. </li>
          <li>Remember to select a release pressure that is appropriate. Keep
              pumping the pump until you hear at least three small release sounds,
              then wait for the pressure to stabilize which should be about five
              seconds. Also do not change the release pressure for the rest of the
              lab or your prediction will be incorrect. </li>
      </ul>

      <strong><u>Procedure</u></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <div class="procedure">
      <ul>
        <li>
          First insert the steel ball into the launch chamber with your index
          finger and push the ball into the barrel. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Pump the hand pump until it reaches your selected pressure. Now
          keep pumping until you hear the three small release sounds. Wait five
          seconds for the pressure to stabilize.
        </li>
        <li>Collect data using the following steps:
          <ul>
          <li>Click the “collect” button to start data collection. </li>
          <li>Hold the cardboard box so you can catch the ball right after it
              leaves the projectile launcher. Do not let the ball hit the floor.
              This is important. </li>
          <li>When you want to launch the ball, press and hold the arm
              button, and then press the launch button. </li>
          <li>Record the speed in the data table. </li>
      </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat this process, catching the ball with the cardboard box until you
complete a total of 10 launch speed measurements. Record the values of
the speed in Table 1. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Review your speed data of each trial and calculate the average speed
          values and identify the maximum and minimum values. Record those
          values in Table 2. 
        </li>
        <li>Determine the launch height by:
         <ul>
          <li>Measuring the distance for the tabletop to the floor. </li>
          <li>The launch chamber of the projectile launcher is 0.146 m above the
              surface of the table. So determine the total distance the ball will fall. </li>
          <li>Record this total height value as the launch height, in table 2. </li>
         </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Identify the floor origin and table offset: 
          <ul>
              <li>The launch point is clearly marked on the projectile launcher. Position
                  the projectile launcher so that you can figure out the distance from
                  the launch point to the edge of the table, in line with the launch barrel.
                  You will need this offset distance for later calculations. Record the
                  offset values in table 2</li>
              <li>Use a meter stick to locate the floor location just below the table
                  edge. Mark this point with table as it will serve as the floor origin.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Determine the predicted impact point range:
          <ul>
              <li>Use the average speed value to calculate your prediction for the
                  range. The range is the horizontal distance the ball will travel. Record
                  this prediction as the predicted range for the average speed in Table
                  3. </li>
              <li>Subtract the table offset from the predicted range and record that
                  value in Table 3 for predicted floor distance for the average speed. </li>
                  <li>To account for variations seen in the speed measurements, repeat
                      the calculation for the minimum and maximum speeds. These two
                      new points show the limits of impact range to be expected,
                      considering the variations of the speed measurements. Record the
                      predicted ranges and floor distances for the max and min speeds on
                      the data table. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>. Tape a piece of waxed paper to the floor that is big enough to account
          for the different variations that you previously calculated. Remember that
          the waxed paper must be lined up with the launch chamber. </li>
        <li>Next launch the ball and allow it to strike the floor for the first time.
          Measure the distance from the floor origin to the actual impact point and
          enter the floor distance in the Table 4. Now calculate the range for the
          actual impact. </li>
      </ul>
